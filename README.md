Problem Statement: 

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate ‚ÄúBusiness and Data Intelligence‚Äù to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Task: 
I am a data analyst who has been provided with sample data and a mock-up dashboard to work on the following task. 
1.	Create the metrics according to the metric list.
2.	Create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.
3.	Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.
